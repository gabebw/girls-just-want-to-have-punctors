yonder over there
you and the horse you rode in on
you bet your boots
you betcha
you can bet your bottom dollar
you can run but you can't hide
you can thank your lucky stars
you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
you can't sell anybody if you don't love everybody
you can't tell a book by its cover
you don't miss the water till the well runs dry
you got it
you had to be there
you have to be good to be lucky
you need money to make money
you reap whatsoever you sow
you snooze, you lose
you're kidding
you're on
you're only as good as your last shift
you've got to be kidding
young at heart
your goose is cooked
your lip
your number is up
your own worst enemy
your turn
